# Book Search Engine Starter Code

## Description

This app allows a user to search for books, add them to a reading list, and delete them. This app uses react, apollo/client, and graphql to connect both front-end and back end functionality.

## Usage

To use this application the user must sign up or login to save and delete any books they search for. To be able to use this app, the user must run `npm i` in the root folder,  `npm i @apollo/client` in the client folder & run `npm i apollo-client-express` in the server folder. Once these are installed, the user can run `npm run develop` to get the app running online for testing. To deploy the app to Heroku, the user must create a Mongo Atlas account to link with.
